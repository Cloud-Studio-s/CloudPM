> Fork of [PocketMine‑MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition servers. 🌍

## What is CloudPM? 🚀

CloudPM is a: ⚙️

- better **performance** on Bedrock servers, 🚀
- smarter **chunk sending** and **network** behavior, 📦
- staying **as compatible as possible** with PocketMine‑MP plugins (at least in early versions). 🧩

In short: it’s PocketMine‑MP with some hot paths of the engine reworked for speed. ⚡

---

## Future & API changes 🔮

CloudPM is **not** intended to remain a drop‑in clone forever. ⚠️

Planned direction:

- more **aggressive optimizations** than upstream PocketMine‑MP, 🚀
- additional **configuration options** for performance tuning, 🛠️
- deeper **engine changes** (ticks, entities, networking), 🧠
- and therefore **possible API changes and breakage** to enable those optimizations. ⚠️

In practice: 📌

- **Today**: mostly compatible with PocketMine‑MP, with internal performance tweaks. ✅
- **Future**: expect differences; plugins should be **tested directly on CloudPM** and not assume full long‑term API compatibility with upstream. ⚠️
